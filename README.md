# Dwelling Machine

Welcome to the **Dwelling Machine** project! This unique web experience invites you to explore speculative spatial designs through a fully interactive 3D website. Powered by the robust Three.js library, Dwelling Machine offers a series of dynamic scenes that merge the boundaries of architecture, art, and digital experience.

## About the Project

Dwelling Machine is more than just a 3D website; it's a journey through a meticulously crafted digital world. Each scene is designed as a giant stage set, featuring elements of both grandeur and intricate machinery. From giant billboards adorned with fixed backdrops to mechanical foliage and artificial suns on rails, the environment is a harmonious blend of industrial aesthetic and luxurious opulence.

Materials such as raw metal infrastructure and elegant marble contribute to the immersive atmosphere, allowing visitors to experience a space that feels both industrial and lavish.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Scenes**: Explore multiple scenes where the boundary between the mechanical and the luxurious blurs.
- **Interactive Elements**: Engage with the environment through clicks and other interactions, guiding you through the site's storyline and revealing the depth of the speculative design.
- **Animation & Interaction**: Witness the seamless integration of animation and interaction within the 3D space, enhancing the exploratory experience.
- **Storyline Integration**: Follow a carefully designed storyline that automatically adjusts the camera position, bringing the digital world to life and guiding you through the narrative landscape.

## Technology

Dwelling Machine is built using the Three.js library, leveraging WebGL to create an immersive 3D experience directly in your browser. The project combines advanced graphics, interactive elements, and dynamic lighting to craft scenes that are rich in detail and full of life.
